These are the SMF scripts and manifests used to construct the various
desktop caches.

The corresponding Tribblix package is TRIBsvc-gnome-desktop-cache - the
gnome part of the name is a bit of a misnomer, but that was what the
package was called when imported from OpenIndiana, and I can't be bothered
to change the name now.
